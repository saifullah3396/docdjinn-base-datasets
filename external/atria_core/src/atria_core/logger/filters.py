Logger Filters Module

This module defines custom logging filters for distributed systems. These filters
allow log records to be processed conditionally based on the rank of the current
process, which is useful in distributed training setups.

Classes:
    - DistributedFilter: A logging filter that processes log records only if the rank is zero.

Dependencies:
    - logging: For defining and managing log filters.
